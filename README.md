# Jeroen Leenarts
I am a software developer currently specialized in iOS development. But I have a long and varied history working on all kinds of technical challenging systems.I started working as a software developer in 2002.

I publish a podcast for iOS app developers with a weekly news & community episode and an interview episode when available. More info on that: https://appforce1.net/podcast/

I am also one of the main organizers of the Dutch CocoaHeads, a monthly meetup community for iOS developers: https://cocoaheads.nl/
